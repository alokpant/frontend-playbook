# The Front-End Playbook
<!-- Main reference taken from: https://github.com/springernature/frontend-playbook -->

This repository entails how we run software development and how we make web and mobile products together. It is filled with things we have learned based on our experience and study of others experiences.

Playbook can be divided into different sections:
- Accessibility
- CSS
- HTML Markup

- Git
